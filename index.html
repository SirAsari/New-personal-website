            <p class="isi">My name's As'ari, and I'm a Programmer.<br>I started this journey since I became a part of Wikrama Vocational
            High School student. Aaand it has been going pretty well in these last couple weeks. Though I must say that it wasn't easy to get 
            through them, but it went alright.<br><br>I also have a few hobbies that I like to do when I have a free time. Including drawing fictional characters,
            playing an instrument, gaming and just hanging out with friends.</p>
